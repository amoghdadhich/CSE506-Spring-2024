Objectives
1) Implement small file optimization - read/write/open syscalls
2) Truncate system call / Delete syscall
3) Journalling file size changes to avoid block reuse
4) Make directories syscall ????????????

Side tasks
1) Create a file system stats tool (usage/free blocks/???)
2) Design workloads to test

Future work
1) Address out of in memory buffer error : There needs to be a way to decide which blocks to cache
2) Accessing the latest blocks, maintaining some form of versioning information : an in memory block is flushed 
but the block has not been written from its disk log to its position on the disk
3) Kernel panics when disk is accessed when writes are in flight
